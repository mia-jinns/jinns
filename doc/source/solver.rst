jinns.solver
==================

The ``solver`` module is decomposed of different parts:

- The `solve()` function which takes care of the optimization process.

- The `Residual Adaptative Refinement` related functions which implement RAR learning.

- The `seq2seq` related functions which implement seq2seq learning.
