Physics Informed Neural Networks with JAX. **jinns** is developed to estimate solutions of ODE and PDE problems using neural networks, with a strong focus on

 1. inverse problems: find equation parameters given noisy/indirect observations
 2. meta-modeling: solve for a parametric family of differential equations

It can also be used for forward problems and hybrid-modeling.

**jinns** specific points:

- **jinns uses JAX** - It is directed to JAX users: forward and backward autodiff, vmapping, jitting and more! No reinventing the wheel: it relies on the JAX ecosystem whenever possible, such as [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox/) for neural networks or [optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/) for optimization.

- **jinns is highly modular** - It gives users maximum control for defining their problems, and extending the package. The maths and computations are visible and not hidden behind layers of code!

- **jinns is efficient** - It compares favorably to other existing Python package for PINNs on the [PINNacle benchmarks](https://github.com/i207M/PINNacle/), as demonstrated in the table below. For more details on the benchmarks, checkout the [PINN multi-library benchmark](https://gitlab.com/mia_jinns/pinn-multi-library-benchmark)

- Implemented PINN architectures
    - Vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptron popular accross the PINNs litterature.

    - [Separable PINNs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dEySGIcDnI): allows to leverage forward-mode autodiff for computational speed.

    - [Hyper PINNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01008.pdf): useful for meta-modeling
