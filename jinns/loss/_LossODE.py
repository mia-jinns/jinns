        Parameters
        ----------
        u :
            the PINN
        loss_weights :
            a dictionary with values used to ponderate each term in the loss
            function. Valid keys are `dyn_loss`, `initial_condition` and `observations`
            Note that we can have jnp.arrays with the same dimension of
            `u` which then ponderates each output of `u`
        dynamic_loss :
            the ODE dynamic part of the loss, basically the differential
            operator :math:`\mathcal{N}[u](t)`. Should implement a method
            `dynamic_loss.evaluate(t, u, params)`.
            Can be None in order to
            access only some part of the evaluate call results.
        derivative_keys
            A dict of lists of strings. In the dict, the key must correspond to
            the loss term keywords. Then each of the values must correspond to keys in the parameter
            dictionary (*at top level only of the parameter dictionary*).
            It enables selecting the set of parameters
            with respect to which the gradients of the dynamic
            loss are computed. If nothing is provided, we set ["nn_params"] for all loss term
            keywords, this is what is typically
            done in solving forward problems, when we only estimate the
            equation solution with a PINN. If some loss terms keywords are
            missing we set their value to ["nn_params"] by default for the same
            reason
        initial_condition :
            tuple of length 2 with initial condition :math:`(t0, u0)`.
            Can be None in order to
            access only some part of the evaluate call results.
        obs_slice:
            slice object specifying the begininning/ending
            slice of u output(s) that is observed (this is then useful for
            multidim PINN). Default is None.

        params
            A dictionary of dictionaries of parameters of the model.
            Typically, it is a dictionary of dictionaries of
            dictionaries: `eq_params` and `nn_params``, respectively the

            Note that params_dict["nn_params"] need not be a dictionary anymore
            but can directly be the parameters. It is useful when working with
            neural networks sharing the same parameters
        batch
            A ODEBatch object.
            Such a named tuple is composed of a batch of time points
            at which to evaluate an optional additional batch of parameters (eg. for
            metamodeling) and an optional additional batch of observed
