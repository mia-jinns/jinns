# Welcome to Jinns' documentation

**Jinns** is a Python package for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in the [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ecosystem. It provides an intuitive and flexible interface for

 * forward problem: learning a PDE solution.
 * inverse problem: learning the parameters of a PDE.
 * meta-modeling: learning a family of PDE indexed by its parameters.

It is built on [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/) and uses [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for optimization. Discover more by navigating the documentation on the left.
