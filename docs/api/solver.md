# jinns' `solve()` function

This is the main function to train the PINN in forward, metamodeling and inverse problems.

::: jinns.solve
    options:
        heading_level: 3

# jinns' `solve_alternate()` function

This functions enables an efficient alternate scheme between `nn_params` and `eq_params`, this is then particularly useful in inverse problems.

::: jinns.solve_alternate
    options:
        heading_level: 3
